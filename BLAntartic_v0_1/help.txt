BLANTARCTIC(1)                 BLAntarctic.py                   BLANTARCTIC(1)

USAGE

    python BLAntarctic.py -n name -s subjects_directory -q queries.multifasta

      · 'name' is an arbitrary string, that will be included in all directories
        generated during the execution of the program.

      · 'subjects_directory' is a directory containing one or several GeneBank
        files (.gbff) of the genomes against which the BLAST analysis is going
        to be conducted.

      · 'queries.multifasta' is a single file in (multi)FASTA format,
        containing the sequence(s) to be used as query/queries.

      optional: [-h] [--eval blast_evalue] [--ident blast_identity]
              [--cov blast_coverage] [--exclude] [-o project.bapj]

OPTIONS
  · [-h] to show help

  · [--eval blast_evalue] Followed by a float, to restrict the minimum e-value
    of BLAST results. Default: 10e-5.

  · [--ident blast_identity] Followed by a float, to set a minimum identity
    threshold for the BLAST results. Default: 30%.

  · [--cov blast_coverage] Followed by a float, to set a minimum coverage
    threshold for the BLAST results. Default: 50%.

  · [--exclude] in order to exclude from the search those PROSITE domains
    marked with /SKIP-FLAG, which are commonly found post-translational
    modifications in the majority of sequences. Removing these domains from the
    analysis may improve visibility of other more relevant domains.

  · [-o project.bapj] Followed by the path to a BLAnatrctic project file
    (*.bapj) to open it and directly access the interactive plots.


DESCRIPTION
  This package is capable of performing a tandem bioinformatic analysis
  (including BLAST, multiple alignment, phylogeny and conserved domains
  characterization) comparing one or more query proteins with the protein
  sequences contained in several GeneBank files.

REQUIREMENTS
  - Python Standard Library modules: os, sys, getopt, datetime, tkinter,
    textwrap, subprocess, shutil, re, pickle. (Are normally included in the
    standard Python installation.)

  - BioPython modules: Seq, SeqIO, Blast, ExPASy, Align, Phylo.

  - Other Python modules: matplotlib.

  - Other software requirements: muscle, NCBI BLAST

  - Databases: prosite.dat and prosite.doc must be manually included in the
    package folder before executing the program (not uploaded to this
    repository due to size limitations

RE-OPENING A PROJECT FILE
  If the user wants to access the interactive view above explained at any other
  moment, the complete analysis doesn't need to be run. By accessing the
  project.bapj file contained in the results directory, the interactive plots
  can be loaded in a much faster way. In order to open the project file, use:

            python BLAntarctic.py -o [path_to_project_file]

OUTPUT
  BLAntarctic generates two folders each time, always in the parent directory containing the package folder, i.e., output folders are created outside the package folder.

    - The name_data directory contains the original input used for the analysis
      (queries and subjects). Both the original GeneBank files ("raw_GBs"
      folder) and a compound multifasta derived from them
      ("genomes_multifasta.fa") are included in this directory.

    - The name_results directory contains all the outputs generated during the
      execution.

        · The raw BLAST results ("blast_results.txt"), as well as the resulting
          file after applying an identity percentage filter
          ("filtered_blast_results.txt"). Those filtered results are further
          rearranged in separate files (one for each query), that are stored in
          the "unaligned_matches" folder.

        · The alignments resulting from MUSCLE, contained in the
          "aligned_matches" folder.

        · The phylogenetic trees built from the alignments previously
          mentioned, both in Newick format ("trees_nw" folder) and their
          corresponding plots in *.pdf files ("trees_plot" folder).

        · Lists of the conserved domains found in the matching proteins for
          each query, in the "protein_domains" folder.

        · Combined plots for the results derived from each query, in the
          "plots" folder. These plots represent the BLAST results, multiple
          alignment and protein domains in a single diagram.

        · A BLAntractic project file (*.bapj) that can be opened anytime with
          the -o option, and gives access to the interactive results without
          having to run the whole analysis.
